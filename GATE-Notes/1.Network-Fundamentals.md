# Network Fundamentals üåêüí°

Learning about computer networks can seem tough, but once you understand the basic building blocks, it's really logical. Think of networking like a highly structured postal service, where each step has rules and specialized jobs.

## Part 1: What is a Network? (The Big Picture)

A network is a collection of communication devices connected together by media links.

### Roles: Client and Server
- **Server:** Powerful computer storing data (e.g., company info).  
- **Client:** Simpler machine (desktop/phone) that requests data from the server.  

**Communication:** Client sends a **request** ‚Üí waits for a **reply** from the server process.

### Network Types
| Category | Scale | Link Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **LAN** (Local Area Network) | Building/campus | Broadcast or Point-to-point |
| **WAN** (Wide Area Network) | Country/continent | Point-to-point |
| **Internetwork (Internet)** | Many interconnected networks | N/A |

## Part 2: Layered Architecture (The Rules)

Networks are designed as a **protocol hierarchy** (stack of layers).  

- **Protocol:** Rules governing communication between matching layers.  
- Each layer provides **services** to the layer above it, hiding implementation details below.

### Internet Model Layers
| Layer | Data Unit | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Application (Layer 5)** | N/A | User services (DNS, HTTP, Email) |
| **Transport (Layer 4)** | Segment | Process-to-process delivery |
| **Network (Layer 3)** | Packet | Host-to-host delivery |
| **Data Link (Layer 2)** | Frame | Node-to-node delivery |
| **Physical (Layer 1)** | Bit | Transmit raw bits |

### Layer Responsibilities

**Layer 1: Physical Layer**
- Moves individual **bits** between nodes.  
- Deals with electrical signals, timing, media, and interfaces.  
- **Transmission Modes:** Simplex, Half-duplex, Full-duplex  

**Layer 2: Data Link Layer**
- Converts unreliable bit stream into a reliable link.  
- **Framing:** Breaks bits into frames (like letters in envelopes).  
- **Addressing:** Physical/MAC addresses.  
- **Sublayers:**  
  - **MAC:** Channel access  
  - **LLC:** Flow/error control  

**Layer 3: Network Layer**
- Sends **packets** from source host ‚Üí destination host.  
- **Addressing:** Logical/IP addresses.  
- **Routing:** Determines best path via routers.  
- **Service:** IP is connectionless and unreliable (best-effort delivery).  

**Layer 4: Transport Layer**
- Ensures messages arrive intact, ordered, and process-to-process.  
- **Addressing:** Port addresses identify destination process.  
- **Protocols:**  
  - **TCP:** Reliable, connection-oriented  
  - **UDP:** Unreliable, connectionless, fast  

**Layer 5: Application Layer**
- Interface for user applications.  
- **Examples:** HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS

## Part 3: Essential Design Concepts

### Connection Types
- **Connection-Oriented:** Establish ‚Üí transfer ‚Üí release. Guarantees order.  
- **Connectionless (Datagram):** Packets routed individually. No order guarantee.  

### Reliability and Control
- **Flow Control:** Prevents sender from overwhelming receiver.  
- **Error Control:** Detects and retransmits damaged/lost frames.  
- **Sliding Window:** Combines flow & error control efficiently; simplifies to **Stop-and-Wait** when window size = 1.
